# take-home-test

At Healthtech-1, one of our core responsibilities is to ingest registration forms, transform them, update some external systems and get them ready for future processing (by the FORM-BOT).
We are sent these forms by a particularly unreliable 3rd party - we should expect them to make schema changes without informing us, send duplicate forms, or generally just be badly behaved!
As this is important healthcare data, we need to design our systems to be resilient to these kinds of errors.

Your task is to code a system for ingesting and processing these forms. For a form to become ready for our bots, it will need to:
- Be ingested into a database (via an `/ingest` endpoint). 
- Conform to the schema we've currently agreed with the external provider. This schema is found in `ingested_schema.ts` (but unfortunately the data source isn't 100% reliable and schema changes aren't always communicated in a timely fashion!)
- Have a longitude and latitude so that we have specific address information for the FORM-BOT. A mock implementation of a geocoding API (to transform the postcode into lat/long) is provided.
- Be transformed into the schema found in `transformed_schema.ts`.

In addition to this, if the transformation/another step is unsuccessful, we'd ideally like to be able to capture the error/data, ship a code change and then handle this form once that change has been deployed (e.g some kind of `/retry` endpoint)

Some additional notes on the system
- The third party external provider does not guarantee exactly once delivery
- We should never give the FORM-BOT the same form twice
- If the transform is successful, we should send a guaranteed email to our team happyforms@bots.com that a form was ingested

Some notes on this take home
- We expect you to add some basic tests to your code
- We expect you to use an actual database, as we'd like to see your schema design
- You can use AI to aid you in this task but please do not just ask Claude to do the whole thing for you
- You are free to pick another server technology (e.g. NestJS) if you wish and even pick another language though please check with us first on language.

How to submit
- The email sent to you has a unique submission link, which will take you to a submission portal
- Please submit on the portal: a link to your repository and a link to a 5 minute (max) loom which explains your code and some of your design decisions
- If possible, please submit within 4-5 days of receiving the task

## Running locally

Requires Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
docker compose up --build   # starts Postgres, Tempo, Grafana, and the app (app on :3000)
docker compose down         # stop (add -v to also drop the Postgres/Tempo volumes)
```

The app runs its own schema migrations on startup, so there's nothing else to set up.


### Example requests

```bash
# Ingest a form (fire-and-forget - processing happens asynchronously)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ingest \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @src/forms/examples/person_one.json

# Read back the transformed form once processing completes
curl http://localhost:3000/forms/GRU-123089-2026

# Check the dead-letter queue for a failed form
curl http://localhost:3000/dlq/GRU-123089-2026

# Retry a DLQ'd form (e.g. after a transient provider error, or a code fix for a schema issue)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/retry/GRU-123089-2026
```

Two scripts wrap the above into end-to-end demos, including polling for the async result:

```bash
./scripts/ingest-example.sh   # happy path: ingest -> validate -> geocode -> store
./scripts/dlq-example.sh      # failure path: schema violation -> non-retryable DLQ
```

### Tracing

The app is instrumented with OpenTelemetry and exports traces via OTLP to a local [Grafana
Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) instance, viewable in Grafana:

1. `docker compose up --build`
2. Exercise the API (e.g. `./scripts/ingest-example.sh`)
3. Open [http://localhost:3001/explore](http://localhost:3001/explore) (no login required), pick the
   **Tempo** datasource, and search - e.g. TraceQL `{resource.service.name="take-home-test"}`

A single `POST /ingest` produces one connected trace spanning the whole pipeline: the HTTP
request, the `ingestion.process` job (running later, on pg-boss's polling loop), and the
`email.process` job it triggers - each a child of the last, with `db.query` and
`geocode.lookupPostcode` nested underneath.
